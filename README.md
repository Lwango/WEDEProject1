Project Overview

The Sweet Buns Bakery Website is a web development project showcasing a fictional Cape Town bakery known for its freshly baked goods, affordability, and friendly atmosphere.
The goal of this project is to apply modern web design principles and front-end development skills to create a professional and fully functional website that reflects the bakery’s warmth, creativity, and community spirit.

Project Goals

Develop a responsive, user-friendly website accessible across devices.

Establish a clear and consistent brand identity (logo, fonts, and color scheme).

Include key pages:

Home – welcoming message and bakery highlights

About Us – story, founders, and values

Services/Menu – baked goods, prices, and custom orders

Gallery – interactive lightbox with product photos

Enquiry/Contact – customer form and social links

Apply semantic HTML, organized CSS, and accessible navigation.

Create an inviting aesthetic consistent with bakery branding.
